## 📝 Notes

The codebase is generally clean and well-structured. The main gaps are in:
- **Accessibility** - Critical for inclusivity
- **Mobile Experience** - Important for reach
- **Polish Features** - Sound, animations, achievements

The simplification work has created a solid foundation. Now focus should shift to:
1. Making it accessible to all users
2. Adding engagement features (sound, achievements)
3. Optimizing for mobile devices
